Stegoracy: A web app for hiding an image in another image
Stegoracy is a web app that allows you to conceal an image inside another image. You can use it to hide some secret message or information as well. Stegoracy uses the [DukeLearning] library for image processing and steganography. Steganography is the art and science of hiding information in plain sight. Stegoracy is secure and easy to use. You can upload two images, one as the cover and one as the secret, and Stegoracy will merge them into one image. You can also extract the secret image from the merged image by uploading it to Stegoracy.

Stegoracy is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [DukeLearning]. It uses the [Bootstrap] framework for responsive design. Stegoracy is hosted on [GitHub Pages] and uses [Cloudinary] for image storage and delivery.

Stegoracy is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested in image processing and steganography. You can find the source code on [GitHub] and report any issues or suggestions on the [issue tracker]. You can also fork the repo and submit pull requests with your own improvements or features.

Stegoracy is a fun and clever way to hide your images in plain sight. Try it out today and see what you can hide! ðŸ˜Š
